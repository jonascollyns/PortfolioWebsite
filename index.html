                <p>I'm known online as "JONAS" and I am a Illustrator/ Photographer from New Zealand that has been making art for 3 years. I'm a Freelance artist taking commissions from all over the world. Mainly making Illustrations for Music artists in the states. Cover art for music is what I mainly tend to make when it comes to selling artwork. I find experimenting in styles quite fun especially when it comes to making my style of art fit into different genres. Throughout this website you can find many of my Illustrations as that is what I spend most of my time with however; because I was making cover art for albums and songs it came to be that I would start making Music videos for local artists in Auckland, New Zealand and this would eventually turn into an intrest with photography and became another artistic form that I experimented with.</p>
